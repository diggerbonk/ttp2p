What is a TTPacket?

All members of the TTP2P network communicate via TTPackets, which 
are a collection of name / value pairs.  How messages are transported 
between members is not important, so long as the information contained 
in the TTPacket remains in tact.  This leaves the decision of transport 
protocol up to whatever is best for the working environment of the 
network member (XML, proprietary binary protocol, carrier pidgeon).

So, as we've explained, a TTPacket is simply a holder of a set of 
name / value pairs.  The meaning of each packet is determined by the 
contents of the set.  There are a few NVP's that each packet are required 
to define in order to be valid, these are:

   NAME              VALUE

   category          High level category classification.  Current 
                     classifications recognized by the network are: 
                     internal, local, peer, discover, and broadcast.

   type              What type of packet this is.  Reserved values are 
                     login, welcome, full, already_connected, node_list, 
                     diconnect, connected, connect_failed, bye, and 
                     request_node_info
   
   to                network id of the user that this message will be 
                     routed to

   from              network id of the user that sent the packet
