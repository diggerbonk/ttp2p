Broadcast Traversal Algorithm

   Broadcasting a packet ensures that the packet sent reaches all nodes 
   on the network.  Here we describe the broadcast algorithm used by 
   ttp2p to achieve this result.
   
   Packet preparation at source node.
   
      The source node creates a packet and assignes it a globally uniqe 
      identifier, which is the unique node id with a locally unique 
      message id concatenated. 
      
      After assembling the packet, it is placed on each of the source 
      node's edges for delivery to neighbors.

   Node handling of an incoming broadcast packet.
      
      First, the node examimes the packet to determine if it is already 
      in the received cache.  If it is in the cache, the packet has 
      already come through the node and it can be dropped.  No further 
      processing is necessary on the packet.
      
      If the packet is new, i.e. it is not in the received cache, then 
      a copy is sent to each edge with the exception of the edge where 
      the node was received.
      
      After the broadcast routing is done, the packet is passed to the 
      node owner for post-route processing.
      
   Efficiency of the algorithm.

      A broadcast message send on a network of N nodes and E edges will 
      require 2E-N+1 network hops to deliver the message to all nodes. 
   
      Here's a table for a mesh network:
   
      N = number of nodes
      m = square root of number of nodes
   
      Nodes Edges    Hops
      N     2(N-m)   3N-4m+1
