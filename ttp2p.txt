   GUMD: Globally Unique Message ID.  Uniquely identifies a packet on 
      the network.  The GUMD is created by combining a packet's source 
      node id with a unique id genertate by the node.  The unique 
      number is incremented by the source node each time a packet is 
      sent.
      
Node Rights

    * Any conformant node may connect to the network.
    * Nodes may have as many as 256 concurrent connections to the 
      network, but must have 6 or less outgoing connections.
    * Nodes must not connect to themselves.
    * Nodes should accept connections from other nodes. 

Node Responsibilities

    * Nodes must not accept connections from themselves.
    * Nodes must not connect to another node more than once.
    * Nodes must not accept more than one connection from another node.
    * Nodes must assign a locally unique numerical id to each packet 
      sent on the network. Preferably, this id should be incremented. 
      The combination of the locally unique id and the node's network 
      id form a globally unique message id - GUMD.
    * Nodes must drop all packets with duplicate GUMD's.
    * When a node accepts a connection, it must tell every other node 
      it is connected to.
    * When a node is told that another node has connected to the 
      network, it must tell every other node that it is connected to.
    * A node must not send packets routed to itself.
    * A node must not accept packets from itself.
    * Nodes must not allow connections from non-conformant nodes.
    * When a node gets a new connection, it should forward a list of up 
      to 10 other available nodes to the newly-connected node.
    * Nodes must never route a packet to the packets source channel, 
      except when converting a peer packet to a discovery packet.
    * On recieving a packet, a node must increment it's hops by one.
    * Nodes must not add themselves to their list of available nodes.
    * Nodes should allow no more than 20 seconds for connecting nodes 
      to complete a login handshake.
    * Nodes must keep a cache of all GUMD's that are not peer packets.
